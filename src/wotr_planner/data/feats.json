This bonus to damage is increased by half (+50%) if you are making an attack with a two-handed weapon, a one handed weapon using two hands,  or a primary natural weapon that adds 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier on damage rolls. This bonus to damage is havled (-50%) if you are making an attack with an off-hand weapon or secondary natural weapon. When your base attack bonus reaches +4, and every 4 points thereafter, the penalty increases by -1 and the bonus to damage increases by +2. The effects of this feat last until your next turn. The bonus damage does not apply to touch sttacks or effects that do not deal hit point damage."

If you hit, you deal damage normally and can make an additional attack (using your full base attack bonus)  against a foe that is adjacent to the first and also within reach. You can only make one additional attack per round with this feat. When you use this feat, you take a -2 penalty to your Armor Class until your next turn."
